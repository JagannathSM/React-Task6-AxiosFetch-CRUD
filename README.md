# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Task Requirements :

[x] Display all the existing API data in UI using Axios.
[x] Users should be able to perform CRUD operations on user data, including adding, editing, and deleting user records.
[x] The user data should be stored in a mock API that can be accessed using Axios fetch.
[x] The UI should have a clean and responsive design that is easy to use and navigate
